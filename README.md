## Performance
### Config
```nginx
server {
  # note that comments must end with "\";\"" ;
  # or some sections may not be recognized ; 
  # the name of the server ;
  actually "\"#\"" is not that essential ;
  # but it looks nice ;
  # well you ask me why this system sucks? ;
  # bro,the code of this system is just about 200 lines ;

  server_name localhost;
  
  # port to listen ;
  listen 9191;
  
  # backlog size ;
  backlog 1024;

  # worker counts ;
  workers 8;

  # epoll settings ;
  epoll {
    event_list_size 1024;
    wait_interval 10 ms;
    module_least_wait 5 ms;
  };

  location "/api/v1/{path}" {
    type proxy;
   
    target {
      name 127.0.0.1;
      port 7000;
    };
    
  };

  location "api/v2/{path}" {
    type proxy;

    target {
      name 127.0.0.1;
      port 7000;
    };
  };

  location "file/{path}" {
    type file;
  
    root "/home/aaaa0ggmc/CChaos";
    index index.html;
  };
}
```
### Internal TestHandler
```bash
# which is expected to receive <h1>HelloWorld</h1>nihao
wrk -t24 -c1000 -d8s http://localhost:9191/handler/nihao 
```

| Property | Value |
| :-------: | :-------: |
| QPS | 11,589.64 |
| Avg.Latency | 83.06ms |
| Max.Latency | 192.68ms |
| Total Requests | 93,722 |
| Throughput | 1.89MB/s |
| Concurrent Connections | 1000 |
| Test Duration | 8.09s |

### Missed Handler
The route tree cant found related handler to the path,mnginx returns 404 immediately.
```bash
wrk -t24 -c1000 -d8s http://localhost:9191/handlers/nihao  # /handlers/{any} doesnt exist! 
```
| Property | Value |
| :-------: | :-------: |
| QPS | 32,174.03 |
| Avg.Latency | 30.49ms |
| Max.Latency | 99.36ms |
| Total Requests | 260,587 |
| Throughput | 1.41MB/s |
| Concurrent Connections | 1,000 |
| Test Duration | 8.10s |
| Error Rate | 100% |

### Reverse Proxy to Flask Server
Performance Analysis: The reverse proxy shows excellent performance when concurrency matches Flask's capacity, but bottlenecks occur with excessive concurrency due to Flask's single-threaded nature.
#### Flask QPS
2800-2900

#### High Concurrency (Flask Bottleneck)
```bash
# Flask development server is single-threaded
wrk -t1 -c1000 -d8s http://localhost:9191/api/v1/
```
| Property | Value |
| :-------: | :-------: |
| QPS | 83.72 |
| Avg.Latency | 1.07s |
| Max.Latency | 1.08s |
| Total Requests | 677 |
| Concurrent Connections | 1,000 |
| Test Duration | 8.09s |
| Timeout Rate | 79.5% |

#### Optimal Concurrency Test (Matching Flask Capacity)
```bash
# 32 connections matches Flask's optimal capacity
wrk -t1 -c32 -d8s http://localhost:9191/api/v1/
```
| Property | Value |
| :-------: | :-------: |
| QPS | 2,559.75 |
| Avg.Latency | 11.99ms |
| Max.Latency | 55.04ms |
| Total Requests | 20,490 |
| Throughput | 479.95KB/s |
| Test Duration | 8.10s |
| Error Rate | 0% |

#### File Proxy
No file caching support currently,which means that 24 threads(24,000 connections) are competing for the fd of that file. 
```bash
wrk -t24 -c1000 -d8s http://localhost:9191/file/lets_chat.c
```
| Property | Value |
| :-------: | :-------: |
| QPS | 3,172.12 |
| Avg.Latency | 40.59ms |
| Total Requests | 25,689 |
| Throughput | 6.77MB/s |
| Read Errors | 48 |
| Error Responses | 24 |

## Final Thoughts (Translated from [ÂÜôÂú®ÊúÄÂêé](./README_cn.md#ÂÜôÂú®ÊúÄÂêé) by DeepSeek)
This project has been more than just an internship assignment‚Äîit was a targeted technical deep dive that yielded significant growth.
### üöÄ Technical Growth
- Progressed from basic TCP/UDP knowledge to mastering complete network programming architecture
- Gained deep understanding of core concepts including Epoll, multi-process models, and HTTP protocol
- Achieved substantial advancement in network programming capabilities
### üèó Engineering Skills Enhancement
- Mastered modular, extensible software architecture design
- Implemented hot-pluggable designs that streamlined multi-threading and hot-reload development
- Improved proficiency in code review and development rhythm management
### üéØ Project Achievements
The current MiniNginx boasts comprehensive production-ready features with an architecture designed for future extensibility. While the load balancing functionality awaits further implementation due to time constraints, the foundational framework is firmly in place.
**In summary, this has been an immensely rewarding technical journey!**
